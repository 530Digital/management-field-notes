Management has 1:1 calls with their direct reports either on a weekly or bi-weekly cadence. This document is to help provide a framework for those 1:1 meetings.
### Cadence and Length
The manager and the staff member can determine the cadence that works best for them. Either weekly or bi-weekly, but we should not go longer than bi-weekly. The length of these calls should be roughly 30-45min.
### Purpose
1:1 meetings are an opportunity for our staff members to connect with their managers and focus on meaningful to them topics which help foster an environment of trust and security. This is an opportunity for the engineer to have conversations that are all about them, or topics they have questions about or need feedback on.

Managers should ensure that the staff member has the opportunity to go first with any of the items they would like to talk about. When done, or if nothing is brought up, the manager can use the remaining time to ask specific questions or take time to directly inform of important items.
