# Candelario Campana Leaving  
Team,

I would like to inform you that [[Candelario Campana]] will be leaving GAP & FINEOS. His last day with us will be 9/6/24.

[[Candelario Campana]] and his family have obtained US Citizenship and will be moving to California to be with the rest of his family. This is an exciting time for him and his family and I sincerely wish them all the best in their new endeavors.

I'd also like to take a moment to thank [[Candelario Campana]] for his hard work and dedication over the years. [[Candelario Campana]] started with Limelight Health in March 2018 and has been a consistent member of the team since. Always willing to do whatever is asked with a great attitude.

Thank you Candelario for everything you have done while here, it was a pleasure working with you sir!

Regards,
Josh
