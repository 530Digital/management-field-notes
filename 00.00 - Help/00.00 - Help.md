# 00.00 - Help
This documentation is intended to help create or view notes.
## Vault Access
This vault template can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/530Digital/management-field-notes). Files are stored locally on your system.
## Setup
There are some basic first things I recommend you do before starting. That is to:

- Create a new person with your name.
	- This is so you can reference yourself in other notes where applicable. For example, in a meeting attendee list.
- Review the templates and update if you want.

### Sections
```dataview
LIST FROM "00.00 - Help" SORT number(split(file.name, "\.")[0]) ASC
```
