## 02.00 - Daily Notes
## How it works

Daily notes are auto-created when you open Obsidian if there isn't already a note with the same date created. The daily note uses the [[Daily Notes Template]]. If you want to adjust the things in your daily note by default, update the template, and it will be reflected in your next note.

**Ways to create a daily note**
- Open Obsidian
	- Automatically creates a new daily note in the format YYYY-MM-DD
